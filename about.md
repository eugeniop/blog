This is my personal technical blog. I'm Eugenio. A problem solver. My background is in electrical engineering and computer science. 

I lead the Customer Success team at [Auth0](https://auth0.com), the company I founded with my brother in arms [Matias Woloski](https://twitter.com/woloski). I love tinkering and building stuff. I work/play with software, hardware, tools, houses, cars, bikes, wood, farms.

I live in the Pacific Northwest, in the United States.
