This is my personal technical blog. I'm Eugenio. A problem solver. My formal background is in electrical engineering and computer science. But I am also a learner. I like stoic principles and philosophy. I enjoy reading the works of Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. I wake in the morning in awe of the world we live in.

I am co-founder and CEO at [Auth0](https://auth0.com), the company I founded with my brother in arms [Matias Woloski](https://twitter.com/woloski). I love tinkering and building stuff. I work/play with software, hardware, tools, houses, cars, bikes, wood, metal, farms. I like lifting heavy things, because then everything seems light (_Tough training, easy combat_). I ride bikes and row boats. I like leading by example.

I live in the Pacific Northwest, in the United States.
