This is my personal technical blog. I'm Eugenio. A problem solver. My background is in electrical engineering and computer science. I like stoic principles and philosophy. I enjoy reading Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius.

I am CEO at [Auth0](https://auth0.com), the company I founded with my brother in arms [Matias Woloski](https://twitter.com/woloski). I love tinkering and building stuff. I work/play with software, hardware, tools, houses, cars, bikes, wood, metal, farms. I lift heavy things. I ride bikes and row boats. I lead by example.

I live in the Pacific Northwest, in the United States.
