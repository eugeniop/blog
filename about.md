This is my personal technical blog. I'm Eugenio, and a problem solver. My background is in electrical engineering and computer science. I lead the Customer Success team at [Auth0](https://auth0.com), the company I founded with my brother in arms Matias Woloski. I love tinkering with many things: software, hardware, tools, houses, cars, bikes, wood, farms.

All opinions here are mine. Content, code, designs are posted here as is, with no warranties of any kind.
