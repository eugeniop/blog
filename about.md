This is my personal technical blog. I'm Eugenio. A problem solver. My formal background is in electrical engineering and computer science. But I am also a learner and am curious about almost everything. I wake in the morning in awe of the world we live in, and grateful for the privilege of living here.

I was the co-founder and the CEO of [Auth0](https://auth0.com), the company I founded with my brother in arms [Matias Woloski](https://twitter.com/woloski). I love tinkering and building stuff. I work/play with software, hardware, tools, houses, cars, bikes, wood, metal, teams, bricks, farms, pots and pans. 

I like lifting heavy things, because then everything seems light. I ride bikes and row boats. I love traveling around the world and history. When in Rome, I order gelato.

All opinions here are mine. Content, code, designs are posted here as is, with no warranties of any kind.
